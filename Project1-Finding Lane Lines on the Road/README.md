Finding Lane Lines on the Road

Overview
-----

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project you will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.

The Project
-----

#### Step1: Set up the CarND Term1 Starter Kit if you haven't already.
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit.git
cd CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit
```

#### step2: Open the code in a Jupyter Notebook
```Bash
source activate carnd-term1
> Jupyter-notebook
```

#### Step 3: Complete the project and submit both the Ipython notebook and the project writeup
